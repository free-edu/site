<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>The Free Education Society is committed to the following principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access to knowledge is a fundamental human right. All humans have a right
  to learn.</li>
  <li>Education must be free as in speech.</li>
  <li>Education must be practical. We reject the idea of a mandatory
  "well-rounded" education.</li>
  <li>Teachers must teach in a socially-responsible way. Students must use that
  knowledge in a socially-responsible way.</li>
  <li>We teach where people need instruction.</li>
  <li>We do not grant degrees, we do not give grades, and we do not pass or fail
  people. The only person who can determine whether a student is passing or
  failing is the student themselves.</li>
  <li>Anyone who teaches according to these principles may teach as the Free
  Education Society.</li>
